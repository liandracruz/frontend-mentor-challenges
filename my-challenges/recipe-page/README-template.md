## My process

My first step was to analyze the challenge's design to decide how the HTML should be structured. After defining the content layout, I created a CSS style sheet to start working on the visual design
In the CSS file, I started adding the fonts and setting up a :root to have a more efficient access to the colors and typography of the project. Next, I first defined the global styles and continued based on the HTML structure. 
I also followed the mobile first approach for better responsiveness and later added media query to adapt the project layout for larger screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media query

### What I learned

Through this challenge I believe my main lesson occurred while working on CSS. I started defining the properties 




To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```
