## My process

My first step was to analyze the challenge's design to decide how the HTML should be structured. After defining the content layout, I created a CSS style sheet to start working on the visual design
In the CSS file, I started adding the fonts and setting up a :root to have a more efficient access to the colors and typography of the project. Next, I first defined the global styles and continued based on the HTML structure. 
I also followed the mobile first approach for better responsiveness and later added media query to adapt the project layout for larger screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media query

### What I learned

Through this challenge my biggest lesson came while working on CSS. I started styling the layout based on the desktop design, which made it difficult to adjust the project responsiveness for smaller screens. But after switching to a mobile-first approach the process became smoother and more efficient.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to keep improving my project structures, especially in CSS. I also want to start incorporating JavaScript to make my projects more interactive and give a better experience for the users.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3 Schools helped me find solutions for some questions that I had through the process, especially about CSS.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The MDN website was an important source that helped me to built a better HTML structure and also find solutions for some issues that I had during the challenge.
